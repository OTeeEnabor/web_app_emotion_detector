Project: Deploy Facial Emotion Recognition Model to streamlit

# Input data - image from web cam
### preprocessing
1. detect the face from the input image
2. resize the image to the model's required input size


# Model -  VGG16 model to classify face emotion recognition
## preprocessing
1. host the model on streamlit
* use the json method to load the model and weights
    advantages and disadvantages of this method
* Use another method
    advantages and disadvantages of this method
2. make the model capable of predicting one image at a time
3. return the emotions and their probability scores
